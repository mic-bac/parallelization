## ‚ö° Parallelization Examples

This project demonstrates how to speed up data processing in Python and R using parallelization. You will learn:

- The difference between serial (one-by-one), parallel (multi-core), and vectorized (library-optimized) computation
- How to use Python's `multiprocessing` and R's `parallel` package
- How to measure and compare computation times
- How to structure code for easy, step-by-step learning (with code chunks)

**Key files:**
- `parallel/`
    - `parallel.py` ‚Äî Python: serial, parallel, and vectorized computation (with explanations)
    - `parallel.R` ‚Äî R: serial, parallel, and vectorized computation (with explanations)

**What you learn:**
- Why parallelization matters for "big" data
- How to use parallel tools in both Python and R
- How to compare performance and choose the right approach

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Example (PostgreSQL)

This project includes simple scripts to show how to write and read data from a PostgreSQL database using Python and pandas. The database is assumed to run in a local container (e.g., Docker).

**Key files:**
- `data/`
  - `db_rw_optional.py` ‚Äî Step-by-step, chunked version for interactive teaching

**Requirements:**
- PostgreSQL running locally (e.g., via Docker)
- Install extra Python packages: `sqlalchemy` and `psycopg2` (see `conda-env.yml`)

**What you learn:**
- How to connect to a database from Python
- How to write a DataFrame to a database table
- How to read data back into pandas

## üì¶ Setup Instructions

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Conda in WSL (optional)

If you haven't installed Conda yet, follow these steps to set it up in your WSL environment:

```bash
# Download Miniconda installer
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh

# Run the installer
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh

# Reload your shell to activate Conda
source ~/.bashrc

# If 'conda' is not found, initialize it:
<PATH-TO-CONDA>/bin/conda init bash

# Confirm installation
conda --version
```

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Create & Activate the Conda Environment

```bash
conda env create -f conda-env.yml

# Activate the environment after creation
conda activate parallel
```

> **Note:** Replace `parallel` with your environment name if it differs.

To check if the environment is activated:

```bash
# List all Conda environments (the active one is marked with an asterisk)
conda info --envs
```
